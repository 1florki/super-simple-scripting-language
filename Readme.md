## super simple language

web code editor and interpreter of a super simple programming language that I used in university (slightly modified for convinience).


### valid commands

- xn = xm + c

- xn = xm - c

- IF xn = c THEN GOTO M3; END;

- LOOP xn THEN P1; END;

- WHILE xn != c THEN P1; END;

### Rules:

- they are only positive integers and only variables xn where n is a positive integer too
- c stands for a constant (hardcoded number)
- LOOP will read the loop count first and then loop
- WHILE will read before each run
- P1 stands for any valid programm
